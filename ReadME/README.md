Hello! 

Welcome to learning about Belly Button data.

This code takes the data from the data.json file and displays it on the html page using DOM manipulation from the app.js file. In the app.js file you will see the page intialized. After the intialization the 2 fuctions are created to create a table and 2 graphs displaying the data for each ID selected in the dropdown. Once the fuctions are built, they are called using a 3rd function that handles the change of the user selecting anew ID in the dropdown. 


Enjoy!
